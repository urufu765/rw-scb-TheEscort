Where ideas I may implement later goes

* Old Escapist
  * Give old escapist the ability to craft explosive bombs, and make that their primary source of firepower
* Railgunner
  * Railgun cyan jump
  * Railgunner gains overcharge from touching electricity, and doesn't die
  * Railgunner railgunning causes a wee bit of fear
