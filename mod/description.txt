A mod that will add The Escort and (eventually) their very special slugpup.
[i]Thank You SomethingStupid for the Escort headshot![/i]

Currently implements The Escort and some of their abilities and movement tech. 
[i]Should[/i] be fully compatible for playing in other campaigns or arena.
[h3]COMPATIBLE WITH LATEST WATCHER UPDATE![/h3]

[b]Feedback of any sort is HIGHLY appreciated![/b]

Found a bug? Put it in the forums or reach me in Discord! I'm in the main RW discord server (as [b]Deathpits[/b]). Feel free to ping me!

Escort's campaign is not 100% finished! The campaign can be completed, however it lacks cutscenes and any rewards. Also the images are super outdated lol. For now, consider this a mod that adds seven different slugcats with common abilities into the game.

These mods may or may not cause issues with the Escort mod, or these are issues that have been found and will be fixed eventually

[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3388224007]Rain Meadow[/url]: [b]For the most part, functional[/b]. However, Escort starting room is not respected, and default body colours may be wrong. Food intake may be a bit wonky as well, further testing required. Feedback would be extremely helpful.
[*] [b]Campaign:[/b] Garbage Waste doesn't work properly (tested before watcher DLC)
